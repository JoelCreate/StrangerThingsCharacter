# Stranger Things Character Quiz

This project is a simple quiz designed to determine which Stranger Things character you are most like. The quiz is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How it works

1. **Quiz**: Answer a series of questions by clicking on "Yes" or "No" buttons.
2. **Result**: After answering all questions, the quiz will reveal which Stranger Things character you are most like.
